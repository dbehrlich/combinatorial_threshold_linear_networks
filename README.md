# combinatorial threshold linear networks

A short notebook containing a python implementation of the model described in "Fixed points of threshold-linear networks" Carina Curto, Jesse Geneson, Katherine Morrison

A basic class that can read in an arbitrary binary numpy array and generate the corresponding ctln graph and some simple experiments on random ctln graphs with different structure (erdos-renyi, barabasi-alberts) included.
